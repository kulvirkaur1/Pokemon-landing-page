                Pokémon is a series of video games developed by Game Freak and
                published by Nintendo and The Pokémon Company as part of the Pokémon
                media franchise. Created by Satoshi Tajiri with assistance from Ken
                Sugimori,the first games released in 1996 in Japan for the Game Boy,
                and the main series of role-playing video games (RPGs), also referred
                as the "core series" by their developers.

                  Water is one of the three basic elemental types along with Fire and

                  simple triangle to explain the type concept easily to new players.
                  Water is the most common type with over 100 Pokémon, which are based
                  on a wide variety of fish and other sea-dwelling creatures.

                  simple triangle to explain the type concept easily to new players.
                  Fire types are notoriously rare in the early stages of the games so
                  choosing the Fire variation starter is often a plus.

              <h2>Q and A</h2>
              <p>Questions Every Pokemon Trainer Should Be Able To Answer</p>
              <p>1.What Pokemon does Pikachu evolve into?</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  We&#39;re sure you know this Electric mouse Pokemon, and you know it
                  quite well. Basic knowledge of Pikachu is essential for every
                  trainer, but you should also be well versed in the rodent&#39;s
                  evolutionary chain. Pikachu, mighty as it is, has an even stronger
                  evolved form also capable of generating vast amounts of electricity.
                  Maybe you&#39;ve bumped into this species in the wild. Either way,
                  this is a question all Pokemon trainers should be able to answer.
                </li>
                <li>Answer is Raichu</li>
              </ul>
              <p>2.What&#39;s the most effective Poke Ball in the game?</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Not all Poke Balls are made equally. There&#39;s the basic model you
                  start your journey off with, but progressive upgrades are needed if
                  you&#39;re looking to keep up with some of the stronger wild Pokemon
                  who emerge in later routes. If you&#39;ve made your way through any
                  Pokemon game, you&#39;ve reached the point where you&#39;re
                  presented with the most effective Poke Ball known to man. This is a
                  one shot catch, and no button mashing at all is required.
                </li>
                <li>Answer is Master Ball</li>

                  Pokémon battles appear in most forms of Pokémon media, being the

                <p>
                  Pokémon Go's Types are exactly the same as those in the main Pokémon
                  games, but the effect of those type matchups is slightly different:
                  in brief, things like effective or resisted attacks have slightly
                  different multipliers to the main Pokémon games - although a
                  December 2018 update brought them slightly closer in line.
